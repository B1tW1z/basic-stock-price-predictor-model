# Google Stock Price Prediction

This project predicts Google stock prices using a Random Forest classifier with data sourced from `yfinance`. It includes backtested predictors to enhance accuracy.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a model that can predict the future movement of Google stock prices based on historical data.

Installation

To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:

- `yfinance`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`

Install the necessary packages using:

```bash
pip install yfinance pandas scikit-learn
```
## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/B1tW1z/basic-stock-price-predictor-model.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. Run the prediction script:


## Backtesting

The model includes backtesting to evaluate its performance. It simulates trades based on model predictions and compares the results to a simple buy-and-hold strategy.

## Note 

This is a very basic implementation of ml model created using yfinance and sklearn. If you have certain issues or want any changes
